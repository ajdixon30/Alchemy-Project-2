# Project 2

## Description

Your next project will build upon the concepts from project 0 & 1, adding the following topics:
 - Angular 4
 - CI/CD
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Data

You will be building a client/server application with a frontend and backend. Your application will use a third party API to get data useful to the service you provide. What service that is, is up to you. Your team should consider your options and come up with an idea for a client/server application that can utilize a third party API to grab data. Your application should meet the minimum requirements set forth below. Your team will work with your trainer to create a series of user stories for your application's MVP.
  
You will be expected to complete the minimum viable product by the deadline and give a brief presentation demonstrating your project and answering questions from the audience.

This project will be done in teams of 5-6 members that will be assigned when we begin.

### Minimum Requirements
1. Proper use of OOP principles and a well layered application structure
2. Users are interfacing with an advanced UI built with Angular running in a browser
4. CRUD operations are supported for one or more domain objects via the web application's API endpoints
5. Client/Server communication is done with JSON in HTTP request and response bodies.
6. All low-level persistence logic is abstracted away with Hibernate/Spring Data
7. Documentation (all classes and methods have adequate Javadoc comments)
8. All Exceptions are caught and logged to a file
9. Data useful to the application is retrieved from a third party API
10. Adequate test coverage for the service-layer
11. DevOps CI/CD pipeline is used to build and deploy project to a publicly available remote location
